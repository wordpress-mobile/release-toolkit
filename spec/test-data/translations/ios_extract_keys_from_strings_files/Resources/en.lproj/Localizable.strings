/* This file is supposed to be the file we send to GlotPress, typically after:
    - generating the initial keys using `ios_generate_strings_file_from_code`
    - merging the keys from other manually-maintained `.strings` files (`InfoPlist.strings` and `Sites.strings`) using `ios_merge_strings_files`
      — without using any key prefixes during merge in this example.
