/*
   This file (`WordPress-Resources/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings`) contains the *originals* for the `Info.plist` keys of the WordPress target,
   and is supposed to be manually-maintained by the developers when they need a new `Info.plist` key translated.

   ---

   Notice how the keys are not quoted in this file.
   This is totally valid to not quote keys in the OpenStep `.strings` format, as long as the keys don't contain any special character.
   Given that for `InfoPlist.strings` the strings keys are the keys you expect to use in the `Info.plist`, they never contain such
   special character, which is why it's quite common to not quote those keys in this file.

   Having those unquoted is a nice touch in our Unit Tests as well as it allows us to test on the side that we also support such cases
   (while most third-party libraries that we could have used to try and manipulate `.strings` files in Ruby... might not have)
