/* This file is supposed to be the file we send to GlotPress, typically after:
    - generating the initial keys using `ios_generate_strings_file_from_code`
    - merging the keys from other manually-maintained `.strings` files (e.g. `InfoPlist.strings` files from both WordPress + Jetpack)
      using `ios_merge_strings_files` — using `wordpress.infoplist.` and `jetpack.infoplist.` key prefixes during the merge in this example.
