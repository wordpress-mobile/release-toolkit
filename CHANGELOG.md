### Breaking Changes

- Make `ios_check_beta_deps` use the `Podfile.lock` instead of `Podfile` for its detection, and also be able to detect Pods referenced by commits and branches.
  If your `Fastfile` called this action with an explicit `podfile: â€¦` argument, you'll have to update the call to use `lockfile:` instead (or rely on defaults). [#557]

   settings to set/update on the target branch (like `lock_branch`, `required_ci_checks`, etc).
   The `addbranchprotection` action name still exists for backward compatibility for now (with a deprecation notice),
   but it will be removed in a future major release. [#513]
- Renamed `removebranchprotection` to `remove_branch_protection`.
   The `removebranchprotection` action name still exists for now for backward compatibility (with a deprecation notice),

## 7.1.0

### New Features

- Add `ios_get_build_number` action to get the current build number from an `xcconfig` file. [#458]


### Internal Changes

- Add "Mobile Secrets" to `configure_update` current branch message to clarify which repo it's referring to. [#455]

- Add the branch information to the 'This is not a release branch' error that's thrown from complete code freeze lane. [#461]
- Update `octokit` to `5.6.1` This is a major version bump from version `4.18`, but is not a breaking change for the Release Toolkit because it doesn't change any public APIs for clients. [#464]
- Update `danger` to `9.3.0`. This is an internal-only change and is not a breaking change for clients. [#464]
- Replace `rspec-buildkite-analytics` with `buildkite-test_collector` (Buildkite renamed the gem) and update it to `2.2.0`. This is another internal-only change and is not a breaking change for clients. [#465]

- Add new `prototype_build_details_comment` action to make it easier to generate the HTML comment about Prototype Builds in PRs. [#449]

### Internal Changes

- Updates `activesupport` to `6.1.7.1`, addressing [a security issue](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j6gc-792m-qgm2). This is a major version change, but as the dependency is internal-only, it shouldn't be a breaking change for clients. [#441]
- Add the explicit dependency to `xcodeproj (~> 1.22)`, used in this case to replace the previous manual parsing of `.xcconfig` files. [#451]

## 6.3.0

### New Features

- Add Mac support to all `common` actions and any relevant `ios` actions [#439]

## 6.2.0

### New Features

- Add a `is_draft` parameter to the `create_release` action to specify whether the release should be created as a draft. [#433]

### Internal Changes

- `promo_screenshots` now supports config files to be written in `YAML` in addition to still supporting `JSON`. [#429]

### Bug Fixes

- Fix deprecation warning in `RMagick` call used by `promo_screenshots` action. [#429]

## 6.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Removed support for the deprecated `GHHELPER_ACCESS` in favor of `GITHUB_TOKEN` as the default environment variable to set the GitHub API token. [#420]
- The `github_token:` parameter (aka `ConfigItem`)â€“or using the corresponding `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var to provide it a valueâ€“is now mandatory for all Fastlane actions that use the GitHub API. [#420]
- The Fastlane action `comment_on_pr` has the parameter `access_key:` replaced by `github_token:`. [#420]

### New Features

- Allow `upload_to_s3` action to just log instead of crash (using new `skip_if_exists` parameter) when the file already exists in the S3 bucket. [#427]

### Bug Fixes

 - Improve resilience of the `ios_lint_localizations` action to support UTF16 files, and to warn and skip files in XML format when trying to detect duplicate keys on `.strings` files. [#418]
 - Work around GitHub API bug when creating a new milestone, where their interpretation of the milestone's due date sent during API call is incorrect when we cross DST change dates â€” leading to milestones created after Oct 30 having due dates set on Sunday instead of Monday. [#419]

## 5.6.0

### New Features

- Add `android_create_avd`, `android_launch_emulator` and `android_shutdown_emulator` actions. [#409]

### Internal Changes

- Remove call to `rake dependencies:pod:clean` from `ios_build_preflight` [#407]

## 5.4.0

### New Features

- Propose to retry when the download of GlotPress translations failed for a locale (especially useful for occurrences of `429 - Too Many Requests` quota limits) [#402]

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes milestones being compared as strings instead of integers in `github_helper.get_last_milestone` [#391]

## 5.1.0

### New Features

* Allow using the `BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN` environment variable for the `buildkite_trigger_build` action. [#386]

_None_

### Internal Changes

_None_

## 4.2.0

* Fix bugs with the shell command in `promo_screenshots_helper`. [#366]

## 4.1.0

### New Features

* Add the option for `an_localize_libs` to provide a `source_id` for each library being merged.
  If provided, that identifier will be added as an `a8c-src-lib` XML attribute to the `<string>` nodes being updated with strings from said library.
  This can be useful to help identify where each string come from in the resulting, merged `strings.xml`. [#351]
* Add the option for `an_localize_libs` to set the `tools:ignore="UnusedResources"` XML attribute for each string being merged from a library. [#354]

### Bug Fixes

* Fix `ios_lint_localizations` action so that it no longer mistakely reports missing keys not yet translated in the other locales' `.strings` as violations. [#353]
* Fix `an_localize_libs` so that it does not move XML nodes around when merging lib strings (and replace them in-place instead). [#358]

### Internal Changes

## 4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Update the API of `ios_merge_strings_files` and `ios_extract_keys_from_strings_files` to support using prefixes for string keys when merging/splitting the files.
  The actions now expect a `Hash` (instead of an `Array`) for the list of files to provide an associated prefix (or `nil` or `''` when none) for each file to merge/split. [#345]

### Bug Fixes

* Improved logs and console output, to avoid `ios_download_strings_files_from_glotpress` to look like it's deadlocked while it takes some time to download all the exports of all the locales, and to avoid the log messages from `ios_extract_keys_from_strings_files` to be misleading. [#344]

## 3.1.0

### New Features

* Introduce new `ios_extract_keys_from_strings_files` action. [#338]
* Add Upload to S3 Action. [#339]

## 3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Removes the `drawText` binary from the gem (instead depending on it being installed via `brew`). Because this update can not be safely applied with no side effects, it's considered a breaking change. [#312]
* When doing Git operations, if no branch is provided, we'll use `trunk` as a default instead of `develop` [#335]
* Remove deprecated `android_merge_translators_strings`, `android_update_metadata`, and `ios_merge_translators_strings` actions [#337]

### New Features

* Introduce new `ios_merge_strings_files` action. [#329]

* Provide new `run_described_fastlane_action` to run Fastlane actions more thoroughly in unit tests [#330]

## 2.3.0

### New Features

* Added parameter for default/base branch across several actions [#319]

## 2.2.0

### New Features

* Added a new `ios_generate_strings_file_from_code` action to replace the now-deprecated `ios_localize_project` action (and `Scripts/localize.py` script in app repos). [#309, #311]
* Added a `comment_on_pr` action to allow commenting on (and updating comments on) PRs. [#313]
* Added the ability to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub operations. `GHHELPER_ACCESS` will be deprecated in a future version. [#313]
* Added support for downloading GitHub content for private repositories [#321]

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug introduced in [#313] that caused the GitHub helper not to work [#318]

## 2.1.0

### New Features

* Added a reminder mechanism for when you forgot a prompt was waiting for you in the Terminal. This reminder is [configurable via environment variables](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/release-toolkit/blob/5c9b79db4bfcb298376fe3e81bc53881795922a5/lib/fastlane/plugin/wpmreleasetoolkit/helper/interactive_prompt_reminder.rb#L3-L22) to change the default delays and optionally opt-in for speaking a voice message in addition to the default beep + dock icon badge. [#302]

### Internal Changes

- Replace CircleCI and GitHub Actions with Buildkite

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Updates the keys used for version reads and bumps when using a `version.properties` file in Android. [#298]
* Removed the `app:` parameter (aka `ConfigItem`) from all the Android version-related actions, now that versions are unified for all apps. [#300]

### Bug Fixes

* Strip trailing new lines in single line msgid when generating .po[t] file. [#297]

## 1.4.0

### New Features

* Add option to skip updating `Deliverfile` when creating a new hotfix version (`ios_bump_version_hotfix`) [#287]

### Bug Fixes

* Fix crashes in actions dealing with hotfixes. [#288]

### Internal Changes

* Opt-out from installing platform-specific gems with Bundler [#293]
* Update gems in the repository to fix `addressable` security vulnerability [#294]

## 1.3.1

### Bug Fixes

* Fix crashes introduced in `1.3.0` â€“ incorrect parameters in calls to `get_release_version`. [#283]
* Fix the way versioning is handled for alphas â€“ i.e. `version.properties` is indexed by flavor name, defaulting to `zalpha` for alphas. [#283]
* Fixed an issue in `check_translation_progress` where a wrong evaluation of the progress is possible when there are Waiting string in GlotPress.

## 1.3.0

### New Features

* Support for a `version.properties` to manage app versioning - all existing paths remain intact and new paths are only used when a `version.properties` file is present.
* Add support for providing an `app:` parameter to most versioning-related actions to allow support for multiple apps hosted in a monorepo.
* Supporting the new `version.properties` file also allows for the `HAS_ALPHA_VERSION` variable to be removed as the alpha reference in the properties file will be used going forward.
* Clients adopting the new `version.properties` will need to implement a gradle task named `updateVersionProperties` to update the `version.properties` file.

### Internal Changes

* Some cleanup to how we scope variables in some of our actions

### Internal Changes

* Updated our rubocop config and fixed some more new/existing violations. [#270]

## 1.0.1

### Internal Changes

* Updated the `gemspec`'s `bundler` and `rubocop` dependencies to fix a publishing warning. [#261]
* Fixed an issue with the `gemspec`'s definition of the `drawText` extension â€“ which prevented the native extension from being built when referencing the toolkit via a version number rather than a tag in your `Gemfile`. [#262]

## 1.0.0

This is our first official release.
